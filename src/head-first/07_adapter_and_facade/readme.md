# Definition

`The adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.`
`The facade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher lever interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.`


# Design principle
`Principle of Least Knowledge - talk only to your immediate friends.`
