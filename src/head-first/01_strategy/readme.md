# Definition

`The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.`
`Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.`

# Design principle

- `Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.`
- `Program to an interface, not an implementation.`
- `Favor composition over inheritance.`
- `Design patterns give you a shared vocabulary with other developers.`
